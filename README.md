# C++ Advanced Exercises Repository

Welcome to my C++ Exercises repository! This collection includes a variety of exercises and assignments, created both for university coursework and technical interview preparations. The code in this repository explores advanced topics in C++ and demonstrates practical implementations of key concepts that are frequently encountered in real-world programming and technical interview scenarios.

## Topics Covered

This repository is organized by topic, with each folder containing specific exercises related to a particular concept in advanced C++. Detailed comments and notes are provided to aid understanding of the underlying principles and design choices made in each exercise. The primary topics covered include:

1. Threading: Examples demonstrating the use of threads for concurrent programming, covering parallel execution and thread management techniques.

2. Monitors: Exercises illustrating synchronization techniques using monitors to safely manage access to shared resources.

3. Smart Pointers: Practical use cases for modern C++ smart pointers (such as std::shared_ptr and std::unique_ptr) that showcase efficient memory management and resource handling through RAII patterns.

## Requirements

This code is written in C++17 and requires a C++17 compatible compiler. It has been tested on:
